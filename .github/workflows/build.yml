# This workflow is triggered every time a PR is opened and master/release branches have a commit.
# The workflow installs dependencies, runs static code analyzers, and runs the test suite.
# todo: Enable Phpstan when all apps are updated to 8.2 and we no more support PHP 7.1.
#  Currently it is impossible to fix Phpstan errors reported on PHP8.2 platform because of deprecations etc.
#  ./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan.neon
